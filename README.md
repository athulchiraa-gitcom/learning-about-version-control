# Learning About Version Control

Author : Athul Sasidharan

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is that I can keep doing whatever I want on branch, no one will know what I do, I just have to pull before I push.  
What I find most challenging about version control is going through GitHub to figure out who edited what part.
